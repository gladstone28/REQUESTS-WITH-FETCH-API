### REQUESTS WITH FETCH API

## Making a POST Request

In the previous exercise, we walked through the boilerplate code for making a POST request using fetch() and .then(). In this exercise, we’re going to use that boilerplate code to shorten a URL using the Rebrandly URL Shortener API.

We will need a Rebrandly API key. To do this, read through the Rebrandly sign up guide to set up your API.

Keep in mind, while it’s ok to use your API key in these exercises, you should not share your key with anyone (not even to ask a question in the forums)! Also, if you reset the exercise at any point, you will have to paste in your API key again at the top.
